# Basic HTML website

This repository includes the various projects I worked on throughout the Basic HTML and CSS course. 
Most of the projects involve applying a basic HTML template, with smaller CSS challenges to learn the cause/effect of certain CSS styles. 

The course finishes off with a basic HTML website, named "Teeny Tiny Tea Town". The website includes a video and various pictures with their captions, as well a rudimentary nav bar and contact form. This will be added to in the upcoming Javascript course.
